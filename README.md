<h2>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Arvis Iljins and I'm the co-founder of Your Guru Net.<h2>
<h3>VIEW FROM THE WORLD IN MY DESIGN<h3>

 My main job is to help shape the idea of the execution and taking part in building products. My passion is to live, to enjoy life. Most people know me as a professional athlete, but there are more. I have traveled far away in the world and saw a lot in it. When I'm working on the formation website I am transferring to you my acquired knowledge. First one, that exploring starts with you, another, that knowledge is power, but enthusiasm pulls the switch.

There is no school that teaches everything to you, except your passion for something. Technology changed every day and you need to change together with the latest innovations, so learn something new every day is the best key to success.
